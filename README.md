### Overview
For ten years now, StackOverflow  has been conducting an annual Developer Survey. Survey results have been made publicly available, and they have been analyzed from many different corners to bring light into a developer profile and trends in the industry. 

As a developer, I am a frequent user of StackOverflow, and always find it very helpful. I have specific questions that I want to find out answers to by analysing the latest Developer Survey result as of now (October, 2020). This survey was conducted in February 2020, right before the whole world entered the Covid-19 quarantine.

### Questions to explore:
1. What is the most popular database in 2020?
2. What is the profile of a StackOverflow frequent user?
3. What is the most important job factor for developers in 2020?

### Process
My analysis process consists of three parts: 
1. **Data Exploration** - where I explore the dataset and its attributes.
2. **Data Preparation** - where I clean, tidy and transform the dataset.
3. **Data Analysis** - where I conduct analysis and find answers to my research questions.

### Summary
MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MS SQL Server are the most popular databases. MongoDB and Redis are rising to a higher demand in the next year.

StackOverflow frequent user is a young male who is a developer by profession with about five years of professional coding experience who also likes to code as a hobby and has been coding for about ten years in general, and is from the North America , India or Europe, has a stable job, but is open to new opportunities.

When considering a job, developers focus on technical languages, frameworks, and technology that they will be working with. They also value office environment, company culture, flexible time, flexible schedule, professional development, and remote work options.

Data analysis of the survey results has been educational, as I had to seek out ways to clean and tidy the data to perform the analysis. It also has been exciting to find out the interesting insights. I would be interested in comparing what have changed in the post-pandemic era in developersâ€™ professional and life choices in the upcoming survey.

You can find more about the analysis on my [Medium blogpost](https://dilorom.medium.com/who-is-driving-traffic-to-stackoverflow-af1ccff251bb).
